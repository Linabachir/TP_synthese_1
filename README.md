# TP_synthese_1
# Objective  
The main objective of this practical task is to develop a micro shell that can execute commands and display details about their execution.  
# Step 1 - Displaying a welcome message, followed by a simple prompt  
To output a message to the terminal, a file descriptor is used:  
`int terminal = STDOUT_FILENO;`  
We then use the 'write()' function, taking the file descriptor and the string we want to display.  
`write(terminal,welcomeMessage,strlen(welcomeMessage));`  
Don't forget to close the file descriptors.  
`close(terminal);`  
# Step 2 - Execution of the entered command and return to the prompt  
## 2.a Reading the entered command.  
To read entered commands from the prompt, we use the 'read()' function, taking the file descriptor based on inputs:  
`bytesRead = read(fd_input, input, sizeof(input));`  
The input accounts for the line break, which needs removal in the input buffer to allow command execution.  
`input[bytesRead-1] = '\0';`  
## 2.b Execution of a simple command (without arguments).  
The 'command()' function uses the fork process to execute commands. The execution and return to the prompt are managed by 'execlp()'.  
## 2.c Returning to the prompt "enseash %" and waiting for the next command.  
The infinite loop allows the shell to display "enseash %" and wait for another prompt each time a command is executed.  
# Step 3 - Handling the shell exit with the "exit" command or "Ctrl+d"  
Within the 'command()' function, we add a condition allowing us to exit the program when either "exit" or "Ctrl+d" is used.  
`if(strcmp(input,"exit") == 0 || bytesRead == 0){   
        write(terminal,exitSucesss,sizeof(exitSucesss));
        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);

    };`  


"exit" is managed by a string comparison (strcmp), while the "Ctrl+d" management is based on the size of the buffer.  
# Step 4 - Displaying the return code (or signal) of the previous command in the prompt  
We use the 'sprintf()' function, formatting a string with the value of our exit code (similarly for the signal code).  
`if (WIFEXITED(status)){
    exit_signal_status = WEXITSTATUS(status);
    sprintfvalue = sprintf(waitingPrompt, "enseash [exit:%d] %% ",exit_signal_status);
}`  
# Step 5 - Measurement of the command execution time using the call clock_gettime  
We can enhance the previous code by displaying the elapsed time using the "clock_gettime" function from the time library. This function serves as a timestamp to calculate Î” t .  
`    if (WIFEXITED(status)){
        exit_signal_status = WEXITSTATUS(status);
        sprintfvalue = sprintf(waitingPrompt, "enseash [exit:%d|%.0f ms] %% ",exit_signal_status,time_elapsed);
    }`  
time_elapsed in milliseconds is calculated by using this formula : $ \Delta t_{ms} = \Delta t_s+\frac{\Delta t_{ns}}{1\times10^{6}}$  
# Step 6 - Execution of a complex command (with arguments)  
char *token = strtok(input, " ");  
We then store these words in an array 'args', and append a null pointer at the end of the array to prepare for command execution by replacing the 'execlp' function with the 'execvp' function.
